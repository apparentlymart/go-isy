// Package isyns ("ISY-NS") is a helper library for implementing ISY "Node
// Servers", which are services that serve as an interface to devices that
// can be monitored and controlled from an ISY.
//
// Node servers are supported in ISY firmware 5.0.0 and above. At the time
// of writing this firmware version is still in a pre-release phase and so
// the node server API -- and thus, this package -- are subject to arbitrary
// change.
